# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to implement Continuous Deployment (CD) to GitHub Pages.

Whenever the `index.html` file is changed and pushed to the `main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and deploys the updated site to GitHub Pages.
